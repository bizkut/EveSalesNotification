This is a comprehensive, multi-user Telegram bot designed to provide EVE Online players with detailed, real-time notifications and daily summaries of their market activities. The bot is fully containerized with Docker for easy deployment and uses a persistent PostgreSQL database to ensure data integrity across restarts.

## Features

- **Multi-User & Character Support**: Any user can add multiple characters by interacting with the bot in a private message. All data is stored securely in a database.
- **Private & Secure**: Notifications and command responses are sent directly to the user who owns the character.
- **Near Real-Time Market Notifications**: Checks for market activity every 60 seconds using efficient ETag-based polling.
- **Dual Notification System**: Differentiates between non-immediate (limit) orders and immediate (market) orders, with separate notification toggles for each buy/sell category. Immediate order notifications are off by default.
- **Intelligent Grouping**: Multiple transactions of the same type are grouped into a single, summarized notification to reduce spam.
- **Rich Contextual Data**:
  - **Real-Time Profit Tracking**: Sales notifications include FIFO-based gross profit calculations.
  - **Live Market Price Context**: Sales are compared against the current best buy order in your main trade hub.
  - **Accurate Trade Location**: Correctly identifies the true location of remote buys/sales by cross-referencing with order history.
  - **Wallet Balance**: All notifications include your current wallet balance.
- **Low Wallet Balance Alert**: Sends a one-time warning if a character's wallet drops below a configurable threshold.
- **Comprehensive Daily Summary**: At a user-defined time, the bot sends a detailed, private financial report for each character (if enabled).
- **View Open Orders**: Interactively browse through all open buy and sell orders in a paginated view. The bot also displays your character's current order capacity (e.g., "152 / 305 orders").
- **Modern Inline Menu**: All bot commands are handled through a clean, interactive inline menu system directly within the chat.
- **Interactive On-Demand Charts**: Generate detailed performance charts directly within Telegram. The summary now includes inline buttons to create an hourly (last 24h), daily (current month), and monthly (for all historical years) performance chart. After viewing a chart, you can easily return to the summary view using the "Back to Summary" button.
- **Highly Configurable**: All major settings (trade region, summary time, wallet alerts, and all notification types) are configurable on a per-character basis via the bot's menu.
- **Robust & Persistent**: Uses a combination of an in-memory cache and a persistent PostgreSQL database to minimize API calls and prevent duplicate notifications.
- **Intelligent Seeding & Backfill**: On first add, the bot intelligently seeds a character's entire transaction history to ensure profit calculations are accurate from day one. To prevent a flood of old alerts, notifications are paused for a few minutes while this initial sync completes silently. You will only be notified of market activity that occurs *after* the sync is finished.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy your own instance of the bot.

### Step 1: Get a Public URL

The bot's web component needs to be accessible from the internet for the EVE Online authentication to work. The easiest way to achieve this is by using the included Cloudflare Tunnel service.

1.  Follow the [Cloudflare guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zerotrust/get-started/create-tunnel/) to create a new tunnel.
2.  In your tunnel's dashboard, configure a **Public Hostname** (e.g., `eve-bot.yourdomain.com`).
3.  Set the service type to **HTTP** and the URL to `webapp:5000`.
4.  Note down your public hostname and the **tunnel token**. You will need these for the next steps.

Alternatively, you can use your own reverse proxy (like Nginx) to expose the `webapp` service on port 5000.

### Step 2: Create an EVE Online Application

1.  Go to the [EVE Online Developers Portal](https://developers.eveonline.com/applications) and log in.
2.  Create a new application.
3.  For the **Callback URL**, enter your public-facing URL from Step 1, followed by `/callback`. For example: `https://eve-bot.yourdomain.com/callback`.
4.  Under the "Scopes" section, add the following required scopes:
    -   `esi-wallet.read_character_wallet.v1`
    -   `esi-markets.read_character_orders.v1`
    -   `esi-universe.read_structures.v1`
    -   `esi-markets.structure_markets.v1`
    -   `esi-skills.read_skills.v1`
5.  Keep the **Client ID** and **Secret Key** handy for the next step.

### Step 3: Configure the Environment

All configuration is handled through a `.env` file.

1.  Create your environment file by copying the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Open `.env` with a text editor and fill in the required values:
    -   `ESI_CLIENT_ID` & `ESI_SECRET_KEY`: From your EVE application in Step 2.
    -   `CALLBACK_URL`: The **exact same** callback URL you used in Step 2.
    -   `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: The token for your bot from BotFather on Telegram.
    -   `WEBAPP_URL`: The public base URL for the webapp component (e.g., `https://eve-bot.yourdomain.com`).
    -   `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Choose a secure password for the database.
    -   `TUNNEL_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare tunnel token from Step 1 (if you are using the tunnel).

### Step 4: Run the Bot

With the configuration complete, you can now build and run the bot using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The bot and its companion web app will now start.

### Step 3: (Optional) Configure Cloudflare Tunnel

This bot includes an integrated [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) service to easily and securely expose the web app to the internet.

1.  Follow the [Cloudflare guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zerotrust/get-started/create-tunnel/) to create a new tunnel. Note down the **tunnel name** and the **tunnel token**.
2.  In your tunnel's dashboard, configure the **Public Hostname**. Set the hostname you want (e.g., `eve.gametrader.my`) to point to the internal `webapp` service at `http://webapp:5000`.
3.  Create a `.env` file by copying the example: `cp .env.example .env`
4.  Open the new `.env` file and paste your **tunnel name** and **token** into the corresponding variables.
5.  Finally, ensure your `CALLBACK_URL` and `WEBAPP_URL` in `config.py` use your public `https` hostname (e.g., `https://eve.gametrader.my`).

If you choose not to use the tunnel, you can safely ignore the `.env` file and will need to set up your own reverse proxy.
