# EVE Online Market Notification Telegram Bot

> **Public Bot Available!**

> Don't want to host the bot yourself? You can use the public instance for free by sending a message to **[@Evegametraderbot](https://t.me/Evegametraderbot)** on Telegram!

This is a comprehensive, multi-user Telegram bot designed to provide EVE Online players with detailed, real-time notifications and daily summaries of their market activities. The bot is fully containerized with Docker for easy deployment and uses a persistent SQLite database to ensure data integrity across restarts.

## Features

- **Multi-User & Character Support**: Any user can add multiple characters by interacting with the bot in a private message. All data is stored securely in a database.
- **Private & Secure**: Notifications and command responses are sent directly to the user who owns the character.
- **Near Real-Time Market Notifications**: Checks for market activity every 60 seconds using efficient ETag-based polling.
- **Intelligent Filtering & Grouping**: Notifications are sent for non-immediate orders, and multiple fills are grouped into a single, summarized notification.
- **Rich Contextual Data**:
  - **Real-Time Profit Tracking**: Sales notifications include FIFO-based gross profit calculations.
  - **Live Market Price Context**: Sales are compared against the current best buy order in your main trade hub.
  - **Trade Location & Wallet Balance**: All notifications include the trade location and your current wallet balance.
- **Low Wallet Balance Alert**: Sends a one-time warning if a character's wallet drops below a configurable threshold.
- **Comprehensive Daily Summary**: At a user-defined time, the bot sends a detailed, private financial report for each character (if enabled).
- **Highly Configurable**: All major settings (trade region, summary time, wallet alerts, etc.) are configurable on a per-character basis via the bot's "Settings" menu.
- **Robust & Persistent**: Uses a combination of an in-memory cache and a persistent SQLite database to minimize API calls and prevent duplicate notifications.
- **Intelligent Seeding & Backfill**: On first add, the bot intelligently seeds a character's history to report only on new activity and ensure profit calculations are accurate from day one.

## Requirements

- A server with Docker and Docker Compose.
- An EVE Online Account.
- A Telegram Bot Token.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy your own instance of the bot.

### Step 1: Create an EVE Online Application

1.  Go to the [EVE Online Developers Portal](https://developers.eveonline.com/applications) and log in.
2.  Create a new application.
3.  Fill in the application details.
4.  For the **Callback URL**, you must enter the public-facing URL of your server where the bot will be hosted, followed by `/callback`. For example: `http://eve.gametrader.my:5000/callback`.
5.  Once the application is created, view its details. Under the "Scopes" section, add the following required scopes:
    -   `esi-wallet.read_character_wallet.v1`
    -   `esi-markets.read_character_orders.v1`
    -   `esi-universe.read_structures.v1`
    -   `esi-markets.structure_markets.v1`
6.  Keep the **Client ID** and **Secret Key** handy for the next step.

### Step 2: Configure the Bot

1.  In the project directory, copy the example configuration file:
    ```bash
    cp config.py.example config.py
    ```
2.  Open `config.py` with a text editor and fill in the following details:
    -   `ESI_CLIENT_ID` & `ESI_SECRET_KEY`: From your EVE application.
    -   `CALLBACK_URL`: The **exact same** callback URL you entered in the EVE application portal.
    -   `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: From your Telegram bot setup (via BotFather).
    -   `WEBAPP_URL`: The public base URL for the webapp. This should be the address of your server. (e.g., `http://eve.gametrader.my:5000`).

### Step 3: Run the Bot

With the configuration complete, you can now build and run the bot using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The bot and its companion web app will now start.

### Step 3: (Optional) Configure Cloudflare Tunnel

This bot includes an integrated [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) service to easily and securely expose the web app to the internet.

1.  Follow the [Cloudflare guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zerotrust/get-started/create-tunnel/) to create a new tunnel. Note down the **tunnel name** and the **tunnel token**.
2.  In your tunnel's dashboard, configure the **Public Hostname**. Set the hostname you want (e.g., `eve.gametrader.my`) to point to the internal `webapp` service at `http://webapp:5000`.
3.  Create a `.env` file by copying the example: `cp .env.example .env`
4.  Open the new `.env` file and paste your **tunnel name** and **token** into the corresponding variables.
5.  Finally, ensure your `CALLBACK_URL` and `WEBAPP_URL` in `config.py` use your public `https` hostname (e.g., `https://eve.gametrader.my`).

If you choose not to use the tunnel, you can safely ignore the `.env` file and will need to set up your own reverse proxy.
